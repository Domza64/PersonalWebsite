            <p>
              The last few days I've been spending some time in VR; I 
              bought a used Oculus rift CV1 for cheap, so I've been going
              to VR Chat parties with a friend and playing some beat saber and stuff...
              <br>
              That's it! That's all I have to say for today. :)

            <h2>It's Spring!<br><u>(25. March 2023.)</u></h2>
            <p>
              Today is such a beautiful spring day, warm 
              but not hot, just a little bit of clouds and no wind...
              <br>
              Literally perfect, so when I woke up in the morning I ate 
              breakfast and went for a bike ride arround the town.
              <br>
              Really chill ride, nothing crazy, just a bit of bunny hopping
              on sidewalks doing whellies'n stuff like that.
              And riding arround a park that has really cool dirt trails
              with trees.

            <h2>Rode My Tomos Today<br><u>(20. March 2023.)</u></h2>
            <p>
              I "completed" my tomos with a friend two days ago.
              There is still so much to do; we have only just got it almost rideable.
              The few meters I drove in first gear to test it out because I hadn't 
              even installed a clutch were so much fun.              
              <br>
              btw, we started it by pushing it in neutral and then changing into first gear.
              <br>
              When I saw Tomos in my garage after I got home from work today, I had to take 
              it out for a spin. The best decision I've ever made, man; even though I only 
              did two loops around my street and shifted into second gear without a clutch 
              (sorry Tomos, not going to do it again), I felt like I was going 100 km/h, 
              it was so fast and so much fun. It essentially made this Monday the best day 
              and provided me with enough joy to last the entire week. The strangest sentence, 
              but sure, this was just so fun I am definitely going to keep riding motorcycles 
              and I am planning to go get a motorcicle licence now.

              Awwww man...
              <br>
              It was absolutely incredible and I was soo bad; I finished last and crashed on the 
              second stage, but for my first race and my first time riding in terrain like 
              this (up until now, I have only ridden on the street and extremely easy beginner 
              trails), I am super happy that I managed to complete all three stages.
              I will try my best to use experience gained from this race to advance in the 
              next one since I know I can do much much better. 
              <br>
              I can't wait to continue this amazing journey, so be sure to check back occasionally 
              for new posts since there will undoubtedly be new posts about all sorts of strange 
              things I do around here.

            <h2>My Tomos APN 4<br><u>(12. March 2023.)</u></h2>
            <p>
              So, since I haven't posted about this here yet, here's a quick summary:
              <br>
              I bought this bike from my friend for super cheap, like 30 bucks or 
              something, and it was so broken and in really bad shape. Everything 
              was so rusted and stuff. I just wanted to restore it for fun, and 
              since it is my first restoration project, I wanted something cheap 
              and simple so I wouldn't have the fear of fucking something up, 
              and this is as cheap and simple as a restoration project can be.
            </p>
            <h3>So I started the restoration...</h3>
            <p>
              Firstly, I took everything apart to the smallest bolt, and then, part by 
              part, I ground down the rust and put on new paint. BUT.. I didn't do 
              that for every part. I fully restored some parts, including the body, 
              rear shocks, fuel tank, and rear (things that hold the rear wheel), 
              and then when time to slowly start putting it all together came, I 
              realized that the front fork was bent beyond repair, so I had to get 
              a new one. I couldn't find a good one on the used market for a while... 
              until a month ago when I finally got one. And today I decided to 
              temporarily give up on full, 100% perfect restoration and just put 
              it together, even if it doesn't look perfect. I just couldn't wait 
              any longer; I had to put it together for a test ride. It's not 
              ready for a test ride yet though; I need to put on the clutch and 
              chain, and then I can finally test ride it for the very first time.
            </p>
            <h3>Current progress:</h3>
            <p>
              Sooo, It is assembled and works; only most important parts though, 
              except chain and clutch wire which are not installed yet. Rear 
              breake and a lot more parts are missing. Also lot of parts are 
              not restored yet. But I will definitely continue perfecting it; 
              I will add all missing parts and restore and paint parts that 
              are not currently restored.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary:</h3>
            <p>
              For now, I will just have fun on this bike, and as time goes 
              on, I will slowly keep fixing new issues as well as adding 
              missing parts and restored parts that have not yet been 
              restored. And I will definitely keep uploading progress 
              here. Also forgive me for really bad writing of this it's 
              really late; I just want to post this so I can go to sleep.
              <br>
              Thanks for reading :>

            <h2>My First Graffiti <br><u>(26. February 2023.)</u></h2>
            <p>
              Actually, it was not on this
              day that I drew it; it was February 18, 2023., but since this 
              page didn't exist at that time, I am just posting it now.
              <br>
              Anyway, as I said, this is my first ever attempt at drawing on
              walls. I've painted with spray cans before, but I've never actually 
              drawn on walls. Considering this, I am really
              proud and happy with how this turned out; obviously, it's not a great graffiti
              piece, but to me, it's amazing, and it was so much fun to make it. I just
              listened to loud music in an old abandoned building while spraying on
              walls; don't know why, but it's just so relaxing and fun that it makes you
              forget about reality and feel like a kid again.

              First "post?" or whatever this is. Pretty cool I guess. 
              Today I just made some changes to the website mostly 
              index page and not design changes but html and css 
              rewrite; it is now much more readable. 
              <br> 
              I just hope that I will continue writing here at 
              least sometimes so that one day in the future I will be 
              able to come back to this and read all the old 
              fun memories.
