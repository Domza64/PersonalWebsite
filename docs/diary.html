            <h2>My First Graffiti <br><u>(26. February 2023.)</u></h2>
            <p>
              Actually, it was not on this
              day that I drew it; it was February 18, 2023., but since this 
              page didn't exist at that time, I am just posting it now.
              <br>
              Anyway, as I said, this is my first ever attempt at drawing on
              walls. I've painted with spray cans before, but I've never actually 
              drawn on walls. Considering this, I am really
              proud and happy with how this turned out; obviously, it's not a great graffiti
              piece, but to me, it's amazing, and it was so much fun to make it. I just
              listened to loud music in an old abandoned building while spraying on
              walls; don't know why, but it's just so relaxing and fun that it makes you
              forget about reality and feel like a kid again.

            <p>
              First "post?" or whatever this is. Pretty cool I guess. 
              Today I just made some changes to the website mostly 
              index page and not design changes but html and css 
              rewrite; it is now much more readable. 
              <br> 
              I just hope that I will continue writing here at 
              least sometimes so that one day in the future I will be 
              able to come back to this and read all the old 
              fun memories.
